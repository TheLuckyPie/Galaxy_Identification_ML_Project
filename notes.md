## Investigations:

### Binary Classification:

Base (Confidence (80%))
Base (Lower Confidence (65%))
Base (RGB, Confidence (80%))

Same with Augments

Same with Everything


### Regression Classification

Using best model (Best AUC curve):

Training Model Ground-Up

Seeing if model with pretrained layers + extra dense layers works well.

TODO: MSE metric, write report based on findings.
